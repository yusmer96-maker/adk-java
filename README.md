Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for developers seeking fine-grained
control and flexibility when building advanced AI agents that are tightly
integrated with services in Google Cloud. It allows you to define agent
behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, enabling robust
debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere – from your laptop to the cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI
    specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse capabilities, all
    for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

-   **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
    directly in Java for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

-   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
    multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

## 🚀 Installation

If you're using Maven, add the following to your dependencies:

<!-- x-release-please-released-start-version -->

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-adk</artifactId>
  <version>1.10.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Dev UI -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
    <artifactId>google-adk-dev</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```

<!-- x-release-please-released-end -->

To instead use an unreleased version, you could use <https://jitpack.io/#google/adk-java/>;
see <https://github.com/enola-dev/LearningADK#jitpack> for an example illustrating this.

## 📚 Documentation

For building, evaluating, and deploying agents by follow the Java
documentation & samples:

*   **[Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)**
*   **[Samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples)**

## 🏁 Feature Highlight

### Same Features & Familiar Interface As Python ADK:

```java
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.tools.GoogleSearchTool;

LlmAgent rootAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
    .name("search_assistant")
    .description("An assistant that can search the web.")
    .model("gemini-2.0-flash") // Or your preferred models
    .instruction("You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.")
    .tools(new GoogleSearchTool())
    .build();
```

### Development UI

Same as the beloved Python Development UI.
A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

### Evaluate Agents

Coming soon...

## 🤖 A2A and ADK integration

For remote agent-to-agent communication, ADK integrates with the
[A2A protocol](https://github.com/google/A2A/).
See `a2a/README.md` for end-to-end setup instructions and sample commands.
