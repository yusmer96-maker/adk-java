/**
 * An inspection-only Java view of a Kotlin [KtBaseAgent]. It exists solely so Java plugin callbacks
 * (handed the running engine agent via [ktAgentAsJava]) can read it as an ADK Java [JavaBaseAgent]:
 * name, description, and the sub-agent tree (each child wrapped the same way, so `subAgents()` and
 * a downward `findAgent()` reflect the real tree). The wrapper is built from the *running* agent
 * downwards, so `parentAgent()` is null and `rootAgent()` returns that agent rather than the true
 * root - Kotlin's `parentAgent`/`rootAgent` are `internal`, so this module cannot wrap from above.
 * It is not meant to be executed: the Kotlin runner is the sole driver of agent execution, so both
 * [runAsyncImpl] and [runLiveImpl] throw. A plugin must not run the agent it is given. The agent's
 * own callbacks are intentionally not exposed (they are lifecycle hooks, not inspection data).
